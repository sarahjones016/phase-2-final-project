## About The App

parkSNYC is a resource for finding and visiting NYC parks. The frontend user interface was engineered using Javascript, React, and responsive design techniques. The frontend application communicates with a JSON server that houses in-depth park information about 25 New York City parks. The application utilizes React Router as the client-side routing method, in order to change what the user sees on the page based on the URL.
